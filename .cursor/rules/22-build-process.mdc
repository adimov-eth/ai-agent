# Build Process and CI/CD

This document outlines the build system configuration and continuous integration/deployment processes.

## Build System

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build specific package
pnpm build --filter @ai-agent/<package-name>

# Clean and rebuild
pnpm clean && pnpm build
```

### Build Order
1. **Shared Package (Bun)**
   - Built first due to type dependencies
   - [packages/shared/package.json](mdc:packages/shared/package.json) defines build process
   - Uses Bun for TypeScript compilation
   - Outputs to `packages/shared/dist`

2. **AI Package (Mastra)**
   - [packages/ai/package.json](mdc:packages/ai/package.json) defines Mastra configuration
   - Depends on shared types
   - Outputs to `packages/ai/.mastra/output`

3. **Telegram Package**
   - [packages/telegram/package.json](mdc:packages/telegram/package.json) defines build
   - Depends on shared types
   - Outputs to `packages/telegram/dist`

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Runs on push to main and pull requests
- Validates types and builds
- Runs tests and linting
- Checks environment configuration

### Build Verification
- Type checking across all packages
- Unit and integration tests
- No runtime type errors allowed
- Environment validation

## Continuous Deployment

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build:prod

# Run deployment checks
pnpm pre:deploy
```

### Deployment Verification
- Environment validation
- Database migrations
- Health checks
- Rollback procedures
